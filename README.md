Upload large files using JQuery to Azure Blob Storage through Azure Web Role WebApi services
=================

The main aim of this project is to provide a working scalable solution to large file uploads to server. In this modern era, when web development taking modern cloud workflows, it is time for us to evolve the traditional problems which we encounter in uploading files. We are pretty sure that traditional ASP.Net Web developers curse Microsoft for making the default size of a file to be uploaded is 4MB. Even though ASP.Net allowed some provisions by making some Config changes (for example - maxRequestLength and executionTimeOut), still server timeouts and long running connections are creating chaos in this particular requirements.

So we wanted to preset a simple and elegant solution throught Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services.
